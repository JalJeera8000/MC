AIM:
To understand the basic function of Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA).

OBJECTIVES:
To understand the function of CDMA used to test orthogonality and autocorrelation of a code.

SOFTWARE & HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS:
Operating System: Unix or Windows 7/8/10

Processor: i3 / i5 / i7

Software: Python (Jupyter Notebook) or Java

THEORY (in Points):
CDMA stands for Code Division Multiple Access, a digital cellular standard.

It uses spread spectrum technology to transmit signals over multiple channels.

Each user is assigned a unique spreading code that spreads the data signal over a wide bandwidth.

Signals from multiple users are added together on the same frequency band.

The orthogonality of codes ensures users don’t interfere with each other.

The receiver retrieves data using the inner product of the combined signal and the target user's code.

CDMA provides secure, private, and robust communication, even in noisy environments.

It’s mainly used in 2G and 3G mobile network systems.
