Problem Statement:
Simulate the Bit Error Rate (BER) performance of BPSK modulation over Rayleigh Fading Channel and compare it with AWGN Channel.

Objectives:
To understand Rayleigh fading and its impact on wireless signal transmission.

To simulate BPSK modulation over Rayleigh and AWGN channels.

To compare the BER performance under both conditions.

Software Requirements:
MATLAB / Octave / Python

Windows/Linux OS

Basic plotting libraries (e.g., matplotlib if using Python)

Theory (in 3 points):
Rayleigh Fading occurs when a signal arrives through multiple indirect paths, causing severe fluctuations in amplitude.

BPSK (Binary Phase Shift Keying) transmits data by changing the phase of the carrier signal to represent binary values (0 and 1).

BER (Bit Error Rate) increases in Rayleigh fading compared to AWGN due to signal distortion from multipath interference.
