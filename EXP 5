Problem Statement:
To configure a Cisco router to function as a DHCP Server and automatically assign IP addresses to connected client devices.

Objectives:
Understand the DORA process (Discover, Offer, Request, Acknowledge) in DHCP.

Learn the benefits of DHCP over manual IP assignment.

Understand how DHCP works in client-server network architecture.

Software Requirements:
Cisco Packet Tracer (Network simulation tool)

Linux-based Open-Source OS (Optional for advanced implementation)

Theory (in points):
DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) is used to dynamically assign IP addresses to devices in a network.

The DORA process is a 4-step handshake between client and server:

Discover: Client broadcasts request for IP.

Offer: Server responds with available IP.

Request: Client requests offered IP.

Ack: Server acknowledges and assigns IP.

DHCP simplifies network management by automating IP assignment, reducing human error and avoiding IP conflicts.

Outcome:
Successfully configure a Cisco router as a DHCP server.

Understand and demonstrate DORA process.

Deploy and test a client-server model with automatic IP assignment.
