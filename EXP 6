Title:
Understanding the Handover Mechanism in Mobile Communication

Problem Statement:
To analyze how handover threshold and margin impact SINR (Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio), call drop probability, and handover probability in a mobile communication system.

Objectives:
Understand the concept of handover/handoff between cells in mobile networks.

Study how handover threshold and handover margin affect performance.

Analyze SINR, call drop probability, and handover probability under varying conditions.

Prerequisites (System Requirements):
Operating System: Windows 7

Java Version: Java 6

Browser: Mozilla Firefox v47.0.1

Theory (in points):
Handover (or Handoff) is the process where a mobile device switches from one cell (base station) to another without dropping the connection.

Handover threshold is the signal strength level at which the handover process is triggered.

Handover margin is the extra buffer value used to prevent unnecessary handovers (ping-pong effect).

Effective handover ensures smooth connectivity, minimizes call drops, and maintains quality of service.
