Title:
File Sharing by Using TCP Protocol

Problem Statement:
To perform file transfer between a client and a server using TCP/IP protocol.

Objectives:
Understand Socket:
A socket is a combination of an IP address and a port number, used as an endpoint for communication.

Understand the Client-Server Model:
A model where the server provides resources or services, and clients request them over a network.

Enable Remote Communication:
Establish connection and data exchange between devices over a network.

Outcome:
Implement a client-server architecture.

Transfer files securely and reliably over a TCP/IP connection using Python.

Software Requirements:
Python

Open-source Linux Operating System

Theory:
TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):
A connection-oriented protocol ensuring reliable and sequential delivery of data.

Socket Programming:
Uses TCP sockets for creating a link between two devices. One acts as a server (listener), and the other as a client (requester).

IP Address & Port:

IP Address: Identifies the device on the network.

Port: Logical channel for data exchange (e.g., Port 8080).

Client-Server Communication Flow:

Server creates and binds a socket to a port and listens.

Client connects using the serverâ€™s IP and port.

Data (e.g., files) is exchanged after connection.
